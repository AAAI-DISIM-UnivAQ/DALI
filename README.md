DALI
====

DALI Multi Agent Systems Framework

DALI is a meta interpreter built on top of Sicstus Prolog (R) (at the moment).

To run a DALI-MAS you need:

- a launching script depending on your O.S. As example we give 
startmas.bat for Windows
startmas.sh for Mac/Linux

- start a Prolog LINDA server (active_server_wi.pl)
- start a Prolog FIPA client (active_user_wi.pl) 
- start 1 instance of DALI metaintepreter for each agent (active_dali_wi.pl)
