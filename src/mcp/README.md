# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation for DALI

## Overview

This directory contains the implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for the DALI multi-agent system. The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools.

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a universal, open standard introduced by Anthropic for connecting AI systems with data sources. It addresses a critical challenge in AI development: even the most sophisticated models are often constrained by their isolation from data, trapped behind information silos and legacy systems.

### Key Concepts

- **Universal Standard**: MCP replaces fragmented integrations with a single protocol
- **Two-way Connections**: Enables secure bidirectional communication between AI systems and data sources
- **Standardized Architecture**: Developers can expose data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers
- **Scalability**: Eliminates the need for custom implementations for each new data source

### Benefits

1. **Simplified Integration**: Instead of maintaining separate connectors for each data source, developers build against a standard protocol
2. **Better Context**: AI systems can maintain context as they move between different tools and datasets
3. **Improved Responses**: Frontier models can produce better, more relevant responses when connected to relevant data
4. **Sustainable Architecture**: Replaces today's fragmented integrations with a more maintainable approach

## DALI MCP Implementation

This implementation allows DALI agents to:

- Connect to external AI services and language models
- Validate assertions and knowledge using AI-powered tools
- Interface with modern AI systems while maintaining DALI's logical reasoning capabilities
- Provide context-aware responses by combining DALI's knowledge base with AI capabilities

## Getting Started

The MCP implementation in DALI allows agents to leverage modern AI capabilities while maintaining their logical reasoning foundation. This hybrid approach combines the structured reasoning of logic programming with the flexibility and knowledge breadth of large language models.

### Example Use Cases

- **Knowledge Validation**: Use AI to validate or enhance agent beliefs and knowledge
- **Context Enhancement**: Provide richer context for agent decision-making
- **Natural Language Processing**: Enable agents to better understand and generate natural language
- **Dynamic Learning**: Allow agents to learn and adapt using AI-powered insights

## Integration with DALI

This MCP implementation extends DALI's capabilities by providing a bridge between traditional logic-based multi-agent systems and modern AI technologies, enabling more sophisticated and context-aware agent behaviors while preserving the formal reasoning capabilities that make DALI powerful for complex multi-agent scenarios.
