# DALI Advanced Examples

In this folder the example show how to define 
classes of agents and agent instances, based on 
sources files.

You define first an agent class in the folder `mas/types'`
then you can define as many instances you want,
only limited by the resources of your machine,
in the folder `mas/instances`

## MAS startup

Be sure to have the terminal multiplexer
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing) 
installed in the system.

Then use the command that should open a multiple terminal 
console in which every single agent shows its messages.

# Debug

- If the `*.sh` files contain Windows line endings, then run the script `./convert_to_unix.sh` to replace the line endings with Unix-style ones.
