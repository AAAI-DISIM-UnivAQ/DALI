# DALI Advanced Examples

In this folder the example show how to define  
classes of agents and agent instances, based on  
sources files.

You define first an agent class in the folder `mas/types'`
then you can define as many instances you want,
only limited by the resources of your machine,
in the folder `mas/instances`

## MAS startup

Your MAS can be started using one of th efollowing startup script options:

* ```startmas.sh``` : launches multiple terminal consoles in separated windows, running the __monolitic__ DALI code (legacy)
* ```startmas_tmux.sh``` : launches multiple terminal consoles in a single window splitted into panes by means of the [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing) utility, running the __monolitic__ DALI code (legacy)
* ```startmas_modular.sh``` : launches multiple terminal consoles in separated windows, running the new __modular__ DALI code (experimental)
